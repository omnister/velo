CNC stepper motor drive with optimized velocity profiling. 

velo.c, interpolate.c: reads x,y,z,w coordinate stream and optimizes
path to obey maximum velocity and acceleration limits, outputs encoded
step pulse bytestream to control stepper motor

feed.c: takes byte stream from velo(1) and sends it via USB2.0 to a
PIC microcontroller chip to generate regular stepper motor pulses for
a general 4-axis stepper motor system.

A typical usage is to take a path and stream it through a pipeline:
