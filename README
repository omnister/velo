doodling towards making a servomotor CNC drive with optimized velocity
profiling. 

velo.c: reads x,y,z stream and optimizes start/end velocities to obey
vmax/amax 

interp: awk script progress xres, yres step by step for a given segment 

ramp: awk script for computing time within a segment

interpolate.c: rewriting interp/ramp in c format as a support routine

Work is to combine interp and ramp into a helper routine and then merge
with velo to do complete stepper timing for N axes. 

3dstep: takes output of velo and processes it into a stream of step
commands for feeding as a bytestream to an FTDI USB fifo chip.
