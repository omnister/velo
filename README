doodling towards making a servomotor CNC drive with optimized velocity profiling.

velo.c	reads x,y,z stream and optimizes start/end velocities to obey vmax/amax
interp  progress xres, yres step by step for a given segment
ramp	awk script for computing time within a segment

Work is to combine interp and ramp into a helper routine and then merge with velo
to do complete stepper timing for 3 axes.
